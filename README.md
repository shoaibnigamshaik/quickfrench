## Examples

QuickFrench ‚Äî A lightning‚Äëfast French vocabulary trainer with multiple‚Äëchoice and typing modes, bi‚Äëdirectional translation, and responsive client‚Äëside caching.

## What you get

- Interactive quiz engine: Multiple‚Äëchoice and typing
- Bi‚Äëdirectional translation: French ‚Üî English
- Topic packs: adjectives, numbers, prepositions, verbs, adverbs, food, travel & transportation, body parts & health
- Category‚Äëaware food vocabulary (fruits, vegetables, drinks, etc.)
- Real‚Äëtime score, streaks, and progress
- Keyboard shortcuts and optional auto‚Äëadvance for tight practice loops
- Responsive, mobile‚Äëfriendly UI

## Why?

I wanted short, high‚Äëtempo vocab reps that didn‚Äôt fight me. The popular tools I tried were slow to start, packed with distractions, and often served irrelevant options. On flaky Wi‚ÄëFi, they stalled right when I had 2 minutes to practice. So I built QuickFrench: a keyboard‚Äëfirst trainer that keeps you in flow‚Äîfast to start, fast to answer, and smart about the words it shows.

Guiding principles

- Speed: Instant feel with local caching; minimal waits between questions.
- Focus: No feeds, no fluff. Clean UI, keyboard shortcuts, and optional auto‚Äëadvance to reduce friction.
- Relevance: Topic packs and category‚Äëaware distractors keep multiple‚Äëchoice options meaningful.
- Flow: Bi‚Äëdirectional translation, quick restarts (R), and tight feedback loops encourage repeat sessions.
- Curriculum: This is taken right off of Cambridge's French as a Foreign Language Syllabus document.
