## Examples

QuickFrench — A lightning‑fast French vocabulary trainer with multiple‑choice and typing modes, bi‑directional translation, and offline‑friendly caching.

## What you get

- Interactive quiz engine: Multiple‑choice and typing
- Bi‑directional translation: French ↔ English
- Topic packs: adjectives, numbers, prepositions, verbs, adverbs, food, travel & transportation, body parts & health
- Category‑aware food vocabulary (fruits, vegetables, drinks, etc.)
- Real‑time score, streaks, and progress
- Keyboard shortcuts and optional auto‑advance for tight practice loops
- Responsive, mobile‑friendly UI

## Why?

I wanted short, high‑tempo vocab reps that didn’t fight me. The popular tools I tried were slow to start, packed with distractions, and often served irrelevant options. On flaky Wi‑Fi, they stalled right when I had 2 minutes to practice. So I built QuickFrench: a keyboard‑first trainer that keeps you in flow—fast to start, fast to answer, and smart about the words it shows.

Guiding principles

- Speed: Instant feel with offline‑friendly caching; minimal waits between questions.
- Focus: No feeds, no fluff. Clean UI, keyboard shortcuts, and optional auto‑advance to reduce friction.
- Relevance: Topic packs and category‑aware distractors keep multiple‑choice options meaningful.
- Flow: Bi‑directional translation, quick restarts (R), and tight feedback loops encourage repeat sessions.
- Curriculum: This is taken right off of Cambridge's French as a Foreign Language Syllabus document.
